<h2>Requirements</h2>

You should have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and at least JDK 1.8 on your system.

<h2>Official Images</h2>

You can find [officially supported images](https://hub.docker.com/u/hazelcast/) in Docker Hub.

<h2>Docker Compose</h2>

> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose see [Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

The `docker-compose` command will pull the images from Docker Hub and then link them together based on the information inside the `docker-compose.yml` file. This will create ports, links between containers, and configure applications as required. After the command completes you can view the status of container with command `docker-compose ps`.


<h2>Hazelcast Docker Code Samples</h2>
